# Product, UX, Character, and Post-Training

Character training is the subset of post-training designed around crafting traits within the model in the manner of its response, rather than the content. Character training, while being important to the user experience within language model chatbots, is effectively non-existent on the web.

We don’t know the trade-offs of what character training does, we don’t know how exactly to study it, we don’t know how much it can improve user preferences on ChatBotArena, and we should.

The appearance of the AIs people are using is deeply coupled with how intelligent users will find it to be. Style of communication is crucial to how information is parsed. This is likely a very high priority to industrial labs, but something that almost no academic literature exists on. Even though I want to do research on this, I’m honestly not sure how to do so yet other than a 1 of 1 technical report on findings.
